## 🎯 Phase 2 Execution Plan

### When You Have Access to Windows:

#### Step 1: Load Documents
Open these files on Windows machine:
1. `docs/PHASE2_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md` ← **Your main guide**
2. `docs/PHASE2_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` ← Keep open for reference
3. `docs/MEMORY_MAP.md` ← Fill this out as you go

#### Step 2: Load Tools
1. Install Cheat Engine 7.5+
2. Launch JX1 game and login
3. Load `tools/JX1_Template.CT` in Cheat Engine
4. Attach to JX1.exe process

#### Step 3: Follow Execution Guide
Work through `PHASE2_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md` step by step:
- ✅ Check boxes as you complete each step
- 📝 Take notes in `MEMORY_MAP.md`
- 💾 Save CE table frequently
- ⏸️ Take breaks between sessions

#### Step 4: Update Code Files
As you find offsets and patterns:
1. Update `core_dll/src/utils/Offsets.h` with actual values
2. Update `core_dll/src/utils/Patterns.h` with actual patterns
3. Complete `docs/MEMORY_MAP.md` with findings

## ⏱️ Time Estimate

| Session | Task | Time |
|---------|------|------|
| Session 1 | Player Structure Discovery | 2-3 hours |
| Session 2 | Entity Manager Discovery | 2-3 hours |
| Session 3 | Function Discovery & Patterns | 2-3 hours |
| Session 4 | Verification & Documentation | 1-2 hours |
| **Total** | | **8-12 hours** |

Can be split across multiple days.
