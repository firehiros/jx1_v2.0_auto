### Finding Player Base Pointer (60 minutes) - CRITICAL

#### Why This Matters
Player HP, MP, etc. are at addresses that CHANGE every game restart.
We need to find a POINTER that always points to the player structure.

#### Steps
- [ ] 1. Right-click "Player HP" address
- [ ] 2. Select "Pointer scan for this address"
- [ ] 3. Click "OK" (use default settings for first try)
- [ ] 4. Wait for scan to complete (can take 1-5 minutes)
- [ ] 5. Note results count: _______ pointers found
- [ ] 6. Save pointer scan: File â†’ Save â†’ "player_hp_pointers.scandata"

#### Narrowing Down Pointers
- [ ] 7. In CE, close game (keep CE open)
- [ ] 8. Restart JX1 and login
- [ ] 9. Find Player HP again with normal scan (quick process now)
- [ ] 10. Note new HP address: _______________________
- [ ] 11. In pointer scan results window:
- [ ] 12. Click "Pointer scanner" â†’ "Rescan memory"
- [ ] 13. Address: [New HP address]
- [ ] 14. Click "OK"
- [ ] 15. This filters to pointers that STILL work
- [ ] 16. Note remaining pointers: _______

#### Selecting Best Pointer
- [ ] 17. Look for pointers with:
  - [ ] Fewest offsets (Level 1-3 is best)
  - [ ] Static base address (green, not red)
  - [ ] Base module "JX1.exe" (not dynamic heap)
- [ ] 18. Double-click best pointer to add to main list
- [ ] 19. Test it:
  - [ ] Close game and CE
  - [ ] Restart game and CE
  - [ ] Load your CE table
  - [ ] Does pointer still show correct HP?
- [ ] 20. If YES â†’ You have a stable pointer! ðŸŽ‰
- [ ] 21. Document pointer chain:
  ```
  Base: JX1.exe + 0x____________
  Offsets: [0x____, 0x____, ...]
  Final offset to HP: 0x____
  ```

**âœ… Checkpoint**: Player base pointer found and verified

---

### Calculating Offsets (30 minutes)

Now that you have the base pointer, calculate offsets for all player values:

- [ ] 1. Note base address: _______________________
- [ ] 2. For each player value, calculate offset:
  ```
  Offset = [Value Address] - [Base Address]
  ```
- [ ] 3. Document offsets:
  ```
  Player Base: [Base Address]
    +0x____: HP
    +0x____: Max HP
    +0x____: MP
    +0x____: Max MP
    +0x____: Position X
    +0x____: Position Y
    +0x____: Position Z
    +0x____: Level
    +0x____: Experience
    +0x____: Gold
    +0x____: Name
  ```

**âœ… Checkpoint**: All player offsets calculated

  - [ ] Absolute addresses (4-byte pointers) â†’ Wildcard
  - [ ] Immediate values that might vary â†’ Wildcard
  - [ ] Stack sizes (sub esp,XX) â†’ Might wildcard
- [ ] 5. Create pattern string:
  ```cpp
  constexpr const char* ATTACK_FUNCTION =
      "\x55\x8B\xEC\x83\xEC\x00\x56\x8B\xF1";
  constexpr const char* ATTACK_FUNCTION_MASK =
      "xxxxx?xxx";
  ```

### Test Patterns (30 minutes)

For this, you'll need to implement basic pattern scanning in C++:

#### Create Test Program
- [ ] 1. On Windows machine, create simple C++ test file:
  ```cpp
  // test_patterns.cpp
  #include <Windows.h>
  #include <iostream>

  uintptr_t FindPattern(HMODULE module, const char* pattern, const char* mask) {
      MODULEINFO modInfo;
      GetModuleInformation(GetCurrentProcess(), module, &modInfo, sizeof(MODULEINFO));

      uintptr_t base = (uintptr_t)module;
      uintptr_t size = modInfo.SizeOfImage;

      size_t patternLength = strlen(mask);

      for (uintptr_t i = 0; i < size - patternLength; i++) {
          bool found = true;
          for (size_t j = 0; j < patternLength; j++) {
              if (mask[j] != '?' && pattern[j] != *(char*)(base + i + j)) {
                  found = false;
                  break;
              }
          }
          if (found) {
              return base + i;
          }
      }
      return 0;
  }

  int main() {
      HMODULE hModule = GetModuleHandleA("JX1.exe");
      if (!hModule) {
          std::cout << "JX1.exe not found!" << std::endl;
          return 1;
      }

      // Test Attack Function pattern
      const char* pattern = "\x55\x8B\xEC\x83\xEC\x00\x56\x8B\xF1";
      const char* mask = "xxxxx?xxx";

      uintptr_t address = FindPattern(hModule, pattern, mask);

      if (address) {
          std::cout << "Attack Function found at: 0x" << std::hex << address << std::endl;
      } else {
          std::cout << "Pattern not found!" << std::endl;
      }

      return 0;
  }
  ```

- [ ] 2. Compile: `cl test_patterns.cpp /EHsc Psapi.lib`
- [ ] 3. Inject into JX1 process or attach debugger

## ðŸš€ Next Steps: Phase 3

You are now ready to proceed to **Phase 3: Implementation**

In Phase 3, you will:

1. **Implement Pattern Scanning**
   - Add pattern scan code to MemoryManager
   - Scan for all patterns on DLL load
   - Store found addresses

2. **Implement Player Class**
   - Create `Player.h` and `Player.cpp`
   - Use offsets from Offsets.h
   - Read player HP, MP, Position in real-time
   - Test with logging

3. **Implement Entity Class**
   - Create `Entity.h` and `Entity.cpp`
   - Read entity list
   - Iterate entities
   - Get entity properties

4. **Test Everything**
   - Inject DLL into JX1
   - Verify real-time data reading
   - Log player stats every second
   - Log nearby entities

### Estimated Time for Phase 3
- 2-3 weeks (10-15 hours)
