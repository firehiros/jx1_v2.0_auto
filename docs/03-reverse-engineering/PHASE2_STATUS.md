## üö® Known Challenges

### Challenge 1: Dynamic Addresses
**Issue**: Addresses change every game restart
**Solution**: Use pointer scanning to find stable base pointers
**Mitigation**: Create patterns for critical addresses

### Challenge 2: Multiple Player Instances
**Issue**: May find multiple instances of player data
**Solution**: Use pointer chains to find the correct instance
**Mitigation**: Verify which instance updates when you perform actions

### Challenge 3: Obfuscated Code
**Issue**: Some functions may be obfuscated or use non-standard calling conventions
**Solution**: Use "Find what accesses/writes" to trace execution
**Mitigation**: Document unusual calling conventions in MEMORY_MAP.md

### Challenge 4: Anti-Debug Protection
**Issue**: Game might detect Cheat Engine
**Solution**: Publisher partnership should allow debugging
**Mitigation**: Contact publisher if issues arise

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### General Tips
1. **Save frequently** - Save Cheat Engine table after every discovery
2. **Document everything** - Write notes as you go, not at the end
3. **Test thoroughly** - Verify each finding multiple times
4. **Use meaningful names** - Label addresses clearly in CE table
5. **Take breaks** - Reverse engineering is mentally intensive

### Cheat Engine Tips
1. **Start with known values** - HP, Level, Gold are easiest to find
2. **Use float scans for positions** - Movement values are usually floats
3. **Use unknown initial value** - For counts and dynamic values
4. **Use pointer scan** - For finding stable pointers
5. **Use "Find what writes"** - For discovering functions

### Pattern Creation Tips
1. **Use unique bytes** - Avoid common instructions (push/pop/mov)
2. **Use enough bytes** - 10-15 bytes minimum for uniqueness
3. **Use wildcards sparingly** - Only for values that truly change
4. **Test patterns** - Verify they work after game restart
5. **Document assembly** - Keep original assembly code in comments

## üìû Support

### If You Get Stuck
1. **Review documentation** - Check PHASE2_REVERSE_ENGINEERING.md
2. **Check quick reference** - See PHASE2_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
3. **Review examples** - Look at pattern examples in Patterns.h
4. **Search online** - Many game hacking tutorials available
5. **Take a break** - Fresh eyes often solve problems

### Common Questions
**Q: I found too many results (1000+)**
A: Be more specific with scan type, wait for more value changes

**Q: Address changes every restart**
A: Use pointer scanning to find stable base pointer

**Q: Can't find function**
A: Use "Find what writes" on a value that the function modifies

**Q: Pattern doesn't work after restart**
A: Pattern might be too specific or include dynamic values, add more wildcards
